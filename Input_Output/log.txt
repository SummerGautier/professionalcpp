Hellow, World!
1. The wind whispers secrets only the trees understand.  
2. Stars flicker like ancient memories in the night sky.  
3. Time moves forward, but echoes of the past remain.  
4. Silence can be louder than the words left unsaid.  
5. Every ending is just the start of something new.
